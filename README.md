## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
A Website dedicated to my passion for Cinema where I will be adding facts and Info related to Cinema, both from the front and the backside of the Camera. What were the ambitions behind some of the greatest pieces of visual art ? What were the inspirations behind some of the most thought - provoking scenes on the screen ? etc.. 
I will also be expanding this to a complete solution for movie - lovers, including movie recommendation system, personal movies list, etc..
The Website is made to view on larger screens.
